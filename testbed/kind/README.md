<h3 align="center">FLUIDOS Node - Testbed (KIND)</h3>
</p>

## Getting Started

This guide will help you to install a FLUIDOS Node **Testbed** using KIND (Kubernetes in Docker). This is the easiest way to install the FLUIDOS Node on a local machine.

This guide has been made only for testing purposes. If you want to install FLUIDOS Node on a production environment, please follow the [official installation guide](/docs/installation/installation.md)

## What will be installed

This guide will create two different Kubernetes clusters:

- **fluidos-consumer**: This cluster (a.k.a., FLUIDOS node) will act as a consumer of FLUIDOS resources. It will be used to deploy a `solver` example CR that will simulate an _Intent resolution_ request. This cluster will use the REAR protocol to communicate with the Provider cluster and to receive available Flavours, reserving the one that best fits the request and purchasing it.

- **fluidos-provider**: This cluster (a.k.a. FLUIDOS node) will act as a provider of FLUIDOS resources. It will offer its own Flavours on the specific request made by the consumer, reserving and selling it.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [KIND](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [Liqo CLI tool](https://docs.liqo.io/en/v0.10.1/installation/liqoctl.html)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fluidos-project/node.git
```

2. Move into the KIND Example folder

```sh
cd testbed/kind
```

3. Set the execution permission on the `setup.sh` script

```sh
chmod +x setup.sh
```

4. Launch the `setup.sh` script

```sh
 ./setup.sh
```

5. Wait for the script to finish. It will take some minutes.

6. After running the script, you can check the status of the pods in the consumer cluster using the following commands:

```sh
export KUBECONFIG=consumer/config
kubectl get pods -n fluidos
```

To inspect resources within the provider cluster, use the kube configuration file of the provider cluster:

```sh
export KUBECONFIG=provider/config
kubectl get pods -n fluidos
```

Alternatively, to avoid continuously changing the **KUBECONFIG** environment variable, you can run `kubectl` by explicitly referencing the kube config file:

```sh
kubectl get pods --kubeconfig "$PWD/consumer/config" --context kind-fluidos-consumer -n fluidos
```

This allows for convenient monitoring of both consumer and provider clusters without the need for manual configuration changes.

6. You should see 3 pods running on the `fluidos-consumer` cluster and 3 pods running on the `fluidos-provider` cluster:

- `node-local-reaource-manager-<random>`
- `node-rear-manager-<random>`
- `node-rear-controller-<random>`

7. You can also check the status of the generated flavours with the following command:

```sh
kubectl get flavours.nodecore.fluidos.eu -n fluidos
```

The result should be something like this:

```
NAME                                   PROVIDER ID   TYPE          CPU           MEMORY       OWNER NAME   OWNER DOMAIN   AVAILABLE   AGE
<domain>-k8s-fluidos-<random-suffix>   kc1pttf3vl    k8s-fluidos   4963020133n   26001300Ki   kc1pttf3vl   fluidos.eu     true        168m
<domain>-k8s-fluidos-<random-suffix>   kc1pttf3vl    k8s-fluidos   4954786678n   25966964Ki   kc1pttf3vl   fluidos.eu     true        168m
```

### Usage

Now lets try to deploy a `solver` example CR on the `fluidos-consumer` cluster.

1. Open a new terminal on the repo and move into the `deployments/node/samples` folder

```sh
cd deployments/node/samples
```

2. Set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to the `fluidos-consumer` cluster

```sh
export KUBECONFIG=../../../testbed/kind/consumer/config
```

3. Deploy the `solver` CR

```sh
kubectl apply -f solver.yaml
```

> **Note**
> Please review the **architecture** field and change it to **amd64** or **arm64** according to your local machine architecture.

4. Check the result of the deployment

```sh
kubectl get solver -n fluidos
```

The result should be something like this:

```
NAMESPACE   NAME            INTENT ID       FIND CANDIDATE   RESERVE AND BUY   PEERING   CANDIDATE PHASE   RESERVING PHASE   PEERING PHASE   STATUS   MESSAGE                           AGE
fluidos     solver-sample   intent-sample   true             true              false     Solved            Solved                            Solved   No need to enstablish a peering   5s
```

5. Other resources have been created, you can check them with the following commands:

```sh
kubectl get flavours.nodecore.fluidos.eu -n fluidos
kubectl get discoveries.advertisement.fluidos.eu -n fluidos
kubectl get reservations.reservation.fluidos.eu -n fluidos
kubectl get contracts.reservation.fluidos.eu -n fluidos
kubectl get peeringcandidates.advertisement.fluidos.eu -n fluidos
kubectl get transactions.reservation.fluidos.eu -n fluidos
```
